			  linuxconsole tools
			    Release 1.4rc1


This package contains the following utilities and associated
documentation:
* evtest - input layer event monitor
* inputattach - connects legacy serial devices to the input layer
* joystick utilities - calibrate and test joysticks and joypads

The evtest and inputattach manpages provide more details on their
operation.


Joystick utilities
------------------

The following utilities are provided to calibrate and test joysticks:
* ffcfstress, ffmvforce, fftest - test force-feedback devices
* ffset - set force-feedback device parameters
* jscal - calibrate joystick devices, reconfigure the axes and buttons
* jscal-store, jscal-restore - store and retrieve joystick device
  settings as configured using jscal
* jstest - test joystick devices

The typical scenario when configuring a new device is as follows:
1. Check the basic functions using jstest (number of buttons, axes,
   etc.).
2. Calibrate the joystick using jscal (this can be useful even if the
   device functions correctly, if only to configure the dead-zone at
   the centre).
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the joystick is configured to the user's
   satisfaction.
4. Store the device's setup using jscal-store.


Installation
------------

To install the utilities and their manpages, run
	make install
from the distribution's top directory. This will install everything
into /usr/local. Should you wish to install the tools elsewhere, you
can use the PREFIX variable:
	PREFIX=/usr make install
The Makefiles also recognise the DESTDIR variable which can be used to
install into a temporary directory (this is useful mainly for
distribution packagers).


Auto-loading inputattach and jscal-restore
------------------------------------------

udev can be used to start inputattach and jscal-restore when the
appropriate device is connected to the system (or detected when the
system is booting up).

The following rule restores the stored calibration and axis/button
mappings whenever a joystick device is connected:
	KERNEL=="js*", ACTION=="add", RUN+="/usr/bin/jscal-restore %E{DEVNAME}"
(change the path as appropriate). This rule needs /usr to be
available, which can cause issues on systems where udev is run from
the initramfs or where /usr is a separate partition. To work around
this, the Debian package uses a script provided by Debian's udev
package to wait for jscal-restore to become available. Should you wish
to reproduce this, you need to create a udev agent
(/lib/udev/jscal-restore) containing the following:

#!/bin/sh -e
# udev agent for jscal-restore

wait_for_file() {
	local file=$1
	local count=120
	while [ $count != 0 ]; do
		[ -e "$file" ] && return 0
		sleep 1
		count=$(($count - 1))
	done
	exit 1
}

(
	wait_for_file /usr/bin/jscal-restore
	exec /usr/bin/jscal-restore $1
) &

and change the udev rule to
	KERNEL=="js*", ACTION=="add", RUN+="/lib/udev/jscal-restore %E{DEVNAME}"

The following rule forces flaky Acrux gamepads to stay awake:
	KERNEL=="js*", ACTION=="add", ATTRS{name}=="ACRUX USB GAMEPAD 8116", RUN+="/bin/sleep 5000 < %p"
(This should only be necessary on kernels older than 2.6.39-rc1.)

The following rule configures a Mouse Systems mouse on the first
serial port:
	KERNEL=="ttyS0", ACTION=="add", RUN+="/usr/bin/inputattach --daemon -msc %p"
If you need to wait for /usr you can adapt the recipe above.

The following rules configures a Wacom W8001 devices on a Fujitsu
T2010[2]:
	SUBSYSTEM=="tty", KERNEL=="ttyS[0-9]*", ATTRS{id}=="FUJ02e5", ACTION=="add", RUN+="/usr/bin/inputattach --daemon --baud 19200 --w8001 /dev/%k"
