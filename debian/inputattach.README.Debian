inputattach for Debian
----------------------

This package does not include an initscript to initialize your
devices automatically; it isn't possible to adequately control
inputattach as would be required for an initscript.

To automatically attach a serial device to the input layer, the
recommended approach is simply to add the appropriate lines to
/etc/rc.local, or to a local udev rules file. For example, to
configure a Mouse Systems mouse on the first serial port:
 * in /etc/rc.local
	inputattach --daemon -msc /dev/ttyS0
 * or in /etc/udev/010_local.rules
	ACTION="add", KERNEL=="ttyS0", RUN+="/lib/udev/inputattach --daemon -msc %p"
The udev rule uses the provided inputattach agent to wait until
inputattach becomes available before attempting to run it.
