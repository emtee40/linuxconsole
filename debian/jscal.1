.SH NAME
jscal \- joystick calibration and remapping program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR jscal
.RI "[" options "] <" device-name ">"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B jscal
calibrates joysticks and maps joystick axes and buttons.
Calibrating a joystick ensures the positions on the various axes are
correctly interpreted.
Mapping axes and buttons allows the meanings of the joystick's axes
and buttons to be redefined.
.PP
On Debian systems the calibration settings can be stored and later
applied automatically using the
.B jscal-store
command.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-c ", " \-\-calibrate
Calibrate the joystick.
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
Print out a summary of available options.
.TP
.BR \-s ", " \-\-set\-correction " <\fInb_axes\fP,\fItype\fP,\fIprecision\fP,\fIcoefficients\fP,...>"
Sets correction to specified values.
For each axis, specify the correction type (0 for none, 1 for "broken
line"), the precision, and if necessary the correction coefficients
("broken line" corrections take four coefficients).
.TP
.BR \-u ", " \-\-set\-mappings " <\fInb_axes\fP,\fIaxmap1\fP,\fIaxmap2\fP,...,\fInb_buttons\fP,\fIbtnmap1\fP,\fIbtnmap2\fP,...>"
Sets axis and button mappings.
\fIn_of_buttons\fP can be set to 0 to remap axes only.
.IP "\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-test\-center\fR"
Tests if the joystick is correctly calibrated.
Returns 2 if the axes are not calibrated, 3 if buttons were pressed, 1
if there was any other error, and 0 on success.
.IP "\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR"
Prints the version numbers of the running joystick driver and that
which jscal was compiled for.
.IP "\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-print\-correction\fR"
Prints the current correction settings.
The format of the output is a jscal command line.
.IP "\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-print\-mappings\fR"
Prints the current axis and button mappings.
The format of the output is a jscal command line.
